# ðŸ§  MindReader9000

MindReader9000 is an AI pattern prediction web app that attempts to guess your next input based on a learned sequence. 

Built using **Python**, **Flask**, and deployed for free on **Render**, the app handles user input patterns like:
- Arithmetic sequences (e.g. `1, 2, 3...`)
- Alphabetic sequences (e.g. `a, b, c...`)
- Repeating or predictable patterns

### ðŸ”® How It Works
- Users type in letters or numbers one by one.
- The AI tries to guess what comes next based on prior inputs.
- Feedback is given on whether the guess was correct.
- Users can **reset**, **start a new pattern**, or **end the game**.

### ðŸ§± Tech Stack
- Python 3.10  
- Flask  
- HTML/CSS (custom neon theme)  
- Deployed via [Render](https://render.com)  
- Version controlled with Git/GitHub
